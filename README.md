# marvis
QGIS plugin for visualization of Marxan data output

## About
Marvis (a conjuction of the words Marxan and Visualizer, rhyming with 'Jarvis' or 'Tardis') is a QGIS plugin for visualizing data output by the open-source conversation planning software, [Marxan](https://github.com/mattwatts/marxan244). It is currently unknown if the web-based Marxan solution uses the same data output format (a plaintext ``.dat``) that the desktop-based Marxan uses. *Therefore, it is unknown if Marvis is compatible with web-based implementations of Marxan.*
