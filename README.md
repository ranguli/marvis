# marvis
QGIS plugin for visualization of Marxan data output

## Status Update
Marvis was mainly developed via an internship during the Summer of 2018. There is currently no work being done on the project.
Right now, Marvis doesn't do anything, and its full scope as not yet been realized. Most of the work was done behind the scenes, such as reading training manuals for [Marxan](https://github.com/mattwatts/marxan244), learning [QGIS](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/) and it's development API, as well as writing project [documentation](https://marvis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## About
Marvis (a conjuction of the words Marxan and Visualizer, rhyming with 'Jarvis' or 'Tardis') will become a QGIS plugin for visualizing data output by the open-source conversation planning software, [Marxan](https://github.com/mattwatts/marxan244).
